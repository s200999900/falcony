# Very tiny README for Bitflu BitTorrent client

Bitflu is a free BitTorrent client. The client was written in Perl and
is designed to run as a daemon (7x24h , like mlnet) on Linux, *BSD and
maybe even OSX.
* Multiple downloads
* Designed to run as a daemon/No GUI: You can connect to the client
  using the telnet or HTTP interface
* Security: The client can chroot itself and drop privileges
* Bandwith shaping (currently only upload)
* Crash-Proof design: Crashes or a full filesystem will never corrupt
  your downloads again :-)
* Non-Threading/(almost)Non-Forking design: All connections are handled
  in non-blocking state using a dynamic select loop
