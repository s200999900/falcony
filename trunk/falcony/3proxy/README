# Very tiny README for tiny proxy 

1. Read documentation at http://3proxy.ru/howtoe.asp;
2. Check /etc/3proxy.cfg configuration file. Now activated HTTP,POP3 and SOCKS proxies;
3. Add /usr/bin/3proxy.sh to startup scripts.

And for HTTP proxies use it if number of users is < 70 users. 
In case of much louding the Squid much is better.
