1.	Make sure you have support for laptop mode in your kernel.
	If you're running 2.6.6 or later you should be fine.
	The laptop mode sysctl is located in /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode

2.	Please run post-install after installing this package since
	my acpid package includes some config files that will interfear 
	with laptop-mode-tools otherwise.
	Following files will be removed.
	/etc/acpi/battery.sh
	/etc/acpi/events/battery.conf
	Those are all included in my own acpid package. If you 
	installed acpid from /unmaintained you should look
	at its footprint and see for yourself.
